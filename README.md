# Doom Emacs' Discourse Theme

[The Doom Emacs project](https://doomemacs.org) has [a Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org). This is its theme.

> Disclaimer: not only am I new to writing discourse themes, this was written hastily with the intention to polish it later. Use at your own risk!

## Color schemes
The ultimate goal is to support [all the color schemes that come with Doom
Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes), but those will come
later.

+ Dark themes
  + [X] doom-one
  + [X] doom-dracula
  + [X] doom-city-lights
  + [x] doom-nord
+ Light themes
  + [X] doom-one-light
  + [ ] doom-flatwhite
